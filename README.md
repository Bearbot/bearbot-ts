# bearbot-ts

An in-progress rewrite of [Bearbot](https://github.com/Bearbot/Bearbot) in TypeScript.

## Building

There really isn't any point in building this (it's still largely incomplete), but if you want to:

```sh
cp .env.example .env # Fill in .env with your configuration.
npm run build
node build/
```
